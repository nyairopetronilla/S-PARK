# S-PARK
# 🚗 AIoT-Based Car Parking System

##  Project Summary

This project was an AIoT-based Smart Parking System aimed at solving the parking congestion problem at a University. By integrating **Arduino-powered sensors**, **real-time monitoring**, and **AI-driven features** (like voice commands and predictive analytics), the system offered a smarter, safer, and more efficient way to manage university parking spaces.

## Objectives
-  Use AI & IoT to monitor parking occupancy and entry/exit in real-time.
-  Reduce time spent searching for parking spots.
-  Implement a voice-enabled assistant to support security personnel.
-  Analyze parking patterns and generate smart reports.
-  Enhance security with real-time slot status and alerts.

## Tech Stack

### Hardware
- **Arduino UNO R3**
- **Infrared (IR) Sensors** for slot & entry/exit detection
- **Servo Motors** for automated barrier control
- **I2C LCD Display** for real-time on-site updates

### Software
- **Arduino IDE** – microcontroller programming
- **Python + Flask** – backend and RESTful API
- **MySQL** – database for all system data
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript + AJAX** – responsive web interface
- **NLTK + spaCy** – voice assistant NLP
- **TensorFlow** – predictive analytics on usage patterns
- **pySerial** – Arduino ↔ Python communication

## Features

-  Role-based access control (Admin/Security)
-  Real-time parking slot availability
-  Vehicle registration & slot assignment
-  AI-powered chatbot for voice queries
-  Usage analytics (charts, stats, predictions)
-  Exportable reports & PDF generation
-  Web UI + LCD interface sync

## Testing & Validation

- Unit, integration, and system testing using a V-model.
- Voice command testing using confusion matrix.


## Future Work Examples

- Add a mobile app with push notifications.
- Integrate license plate recognition with camera feeds.
- Include solar-powered sensors for sustainability.
- Enable digital payments for visitor parking.
- Improve voice command recognition using transformer models.
