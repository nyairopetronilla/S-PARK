# S-PARK
# 🚗 AIoT-Based Car Parking System

## 📘 Project Summary

This project was an AIoT-based Smart Parking System aimed at solving the parking congestion problem at a University. By integrating **Arduino-powered sensors**, **real-time monitoring**, and **AI-driven features** (like voice commands and predictive analytics), the system offered a smarter, safer, and more efficient way to manage university parking spaces.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🧠 Use AI & IoT to monitor parking occupancy and entry/exit in real-time.
- 📉 Reduce time spent searching for parking spots.
- 🎤 Implement a voice-enabled assistant to support security personnel.
- 📊 Analyze parking patterns and generate smart reports.
- 🔒 Enhance security with real-time slot status and alerts.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Hardware
- **Arduino UNO R3**
- **Infrared (IR) Sensors** for slot & entry/exit detection
- **Servo Motors** for automated barrier control
- **I2C LCD Display** for real-time on-site updates

### Software
- **Arduino IDE** – microcontroller programming
- **Python + Flask** – backend and RESTful API
- **MySQL** – database for all system data
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript + AJAX** – responsive web interface
- **NLTK + spaCy** – voice assistant NLP
- **TensorFlow** – predictive analytics on usage patterns
- **pySerial** – Arduino ↔ Python communication

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 Role-based access control (Admin/Security)
- 🚦 Real-time parking slot availability
- 📋 Vehicle registration & slot assignment
- 🗣️ AI-powered chatbot for voice queries
- 📈 Usage analytics (charts, stats, predictions)
- 🧾 Exportable reports & PDF generation
- 🌐 Web UI + LCD interface sync

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Unit, integration, and system testing using a V-model.
- Voice command testing using confusion matrix.


## 🔮 Future Work Examples

- Add a mobile app with push notifications.
- Integrate license plate recognition with camera feeds.
- Include solar-powered sensors for sustainability.
- Enable digital payments for visitor parking.
- Improve voice command recognition using transformer models.
